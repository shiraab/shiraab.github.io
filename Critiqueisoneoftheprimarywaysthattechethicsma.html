System-level critique is one of the primary ways that &ldquo;tech ethics&rdquo; manifests itself, within and outside of academic spaces. I wanted to dive into a discussion of critique, power, action, and change by naming various levels at which a company and the technology it makes can be critiqued.</span>

&nbsp;by Carolyn Chen in my initial ideation and motivation of this essay. I was trained as a literary scholar, so naturally (/s), I also referenced Foucault&rsquo;s &ldquo;What is Critique?&rdquo; to stabilize my notion of critique and its purpose. Finally, I looked at some key sources from </span>

First: critique &amp; distance.</span>
</h2>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Throughout FASPE, I found so many of my peers reluctant to describe themselves as the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; version of whatever their profession may be&mdash;in business and tech, this meant being a person that was invested in public good, policy, or another career outside of the industry entirely.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
I wondered why this was. Why am I, for instance, often so reluctant to describe myself as a software engineer? It&rsquo;s not only because I have a general distaste for the tech industry. I realized that I value a level of distance from my work because I value the ability to critique my workplace, my industry, and my society, even as I attempt to embed myself in all three in order to seize some measure of power and legitimize my critique. (More on this later, when I discuss soft power.)</span>

<p class="c0 c4">

<span>
And critique does require some distance&mdash;at least, it requires one not to buy in fully to the promises of an industry like tech that thrives off hype. In his 1978 talk &ldquo;What is Critique?&rdquo;, Michel Foucault describes critique as an &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; or a &ldquo;gaze&rdquo; which is directed towards &ldquo;a domain that it wants very much to police and where it is incapable of laying down the law.&rdquo; In other words, critique is often used in situations where the critiquer has no power of enforcement. This can mean situations where the critiquer does have some measure of power&mdash;Foucault mentions morality in the Church, for instance. It can also mean anywhere the critiquer does not have </span>
<span class="c6">
hard</span>
<span class="c1">
&nbsp;power&mdash;the power to govern, make decisions, or lay down punishment, for example. This means that critique is especially useful in domains where the critiquer cannot claim control. There&rsquo;s no reason to critique when one has power to make change: critique is subordinate to action. This makes it especially unattractive in the cultural norms of the tech industry, which prioritizes action and scale over all else. [Move fast and break things, bitches.]</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Tech&rsquo;s emphasis on action and scale infect everything within the industry&mdash;even and especially working conditions. The technology industry requires almost everything of us tech workers: our time, our creativity, and&mdash;especially recently, especially in startups&mdash;our belief. In return, we are compensated well, but we are expected to perform high amounts of positivity and &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo;: two antitheses of critique. Across the tech industry, startups have &ldquo;missions&rdquo;; employees are judged during interviews based on whether they believe in it. At face value, that&rsquo;s okay: shouldn&rsquo;t everyone have the opportunity to believe in what they&rsquo;re building? But combined with the US&rsquo;s toxic corporate culture, it can balloon into something cultish and connivingly spiritual, depriving tech workers of their lives outside of work (through long work hours and expectations of socializing and working in the office). It&rsquo;s telling that among many co-workers and friends in the industry, one of the things people cite as a positive indicator for working at a company is whether the company asks people to work long past 5pm. It&rsquo;s such a norm in the industry to stay late and grind out of supposed enjoyment that we have to actively look for an employer who doesn&rsquo;t exploit us.</span>

<span>
Carolyn Chen writes at length about this phenomenon of tech-work-as-spirituality and/or tech-work-as-religion in her recent book </span>
<span class="c6">
Work Pray Code</span>
<span class="c1">
, which I found highly descriptive of the requirement of &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in the tech industry, and the co-optation of religion in service of labor and capitalism. This notion of belief or buy-in is essential to understanding cultures and modes of critique within the industry, and how they are received.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Tech-work-as-spirituality encodes within it tech-work-as-virtue, a subset of productivity as virtue. When effective labor in the industry is seen as a virtuous act, the highest form of worship, critique becomes difficult or even impossible. This is because critique, too, relies on a notion of virtue, at least according to Foucault. By critiquing, one says implicitly: I know a better way. When leveled at non-technical questions by software engineers, this notion of &ldquo;knowing better&rdquo; is a challenge not only to power structures in the industry but also the dominant culture of expecting pure joy, fun, fulfillment, and even enlightenment through work or the workplace.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Those of us who value critiquing the industry from within or from the side therefore hold a boundary of distance by doing so: we consider ourselves uncomfortable with the label of software engineer not because of what we do&mdash;because, for me, I undeniably do build software to make money&mdash;but rather because of how we&rsquo;ve been conditioned that a &ldquo;real software engineer&rdquo; behaves: he (and it is always a he) works long hours, drinks soylent and loves product conversations. He doesn&rsquo;t consider his own power. And he certainly doesn&rsquo;t critique.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span>
I think this manufactured distance is a response to real trends in the industry. For a long time, toxic positivity culture has been dominant, and it still is! I wonder if we might serve ourselves better by embracing the labels of our profession without apology, and remaining &ldquo;software engineers&rdquo; in our own eyes even if we don&rsquo;t much care for the industry.</span>

Note: &ldquo;Bias for Action,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Man in the Arena,&rdquo; and the critical role of the engineer</span>
</h3>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c7 c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Like much of corporate culture, tech tends to be ambivalent or even hostile to critique that comes at the expense of action. At Amazon, this notion of prioritizing action over all else is called having a &ldquo;Bias for Action,&rdquo; which is one of the company&rsquo;s core leadership values. That is, when in doubt: act. It&rsquo;s not quite as strong than Facebook&rsquo;s old maxim to &ldquo;move fast and break things,&rdquo; but it embodies the same idea: action over thought, always.</span>

Tech loves what Theodore Roosevelt, in his &ldquo;Citizenship in the Republic&rdquo; speech of 1910, called &ldquo;The Man In the Arena.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is not the critic who counts,&rdquo; Roosevelt said. &ldquo;The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena&hellip;.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Bias for action, man in the arena, whatever you call it&mdash;the point is, action matters much more than anything else&mdash;and specifically, it matters more than critique.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span>
But the idea of the man in the arena matters also in illuminating the kinds of people who are valued in tech: namely, &ldquo;doers&rdquo; are valued much more than &ldquo;thinkers.&rdquo; This means that software engineers, who often &ldquo;do&rdquo; (read: code) all day, can wield a particularly strong form of soft power, when they play it correctly. Especially at companies with small teams, or at larger companies with an organized workforce, engineers occupy a unique position of clout due to their skilled work, expertise, and generally non-critical attitude. Engineers with a lot of experience, or who are well-regarded within a company as particularly technically competent, cannot be accused as readily of being inactive critiquers, out of the supposed arena. As a result, when engineers </span>
<span class="c6">
do</span>
<span class="c1">
&nbsp;choose to make pointed critiques, they have the recourse to their long record of a bias for action, which they can draw on in substantiating the need for critique.</span>

Most often, when critiques are raised at this level, they are in response to and in justification of specific company practices. These critiques are always valid, they&rsquo;re just usually not seen as actionable within the scope of the industry.<br>

It&rsquo;s become somewhat more popular, as the tech industry grows less popular, for more companies to see themselves as leading the way for a particular cultural issue, especially if it aligns with their mission, so the response can vary.</span>

I&rsquo;m of the opinion that everyone should organize. Organizing means that engineers can more readily and effectively critique at more levels, and that their critiques can more easily be heard and taken into account for the possibility of change.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Whether this is formal organizing, such as forming or joining a union, or informal organizing, such as discussing workplace issues with fellow employees inside or outside of work, organizing is always a more effective strategy than acting alone.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Even so, I still think that the &ldquo;levels of critique&rdquo; above are relevant to organized workplaces too. From discussions with friends working at a variety of companies, it seems that engineers are generally given discretion on code and implementation, and so they may exercise a great deal of power on the level of code. As the levels go up in abstraction and more non-engineers have a stake in decisions, the power of any specific role diminishes, so having more and more people raise their voices is useful.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
I believe that the broadest critiques are the ones that get to the root of the matter, but&mdash;critically&mdash;they are not effective as overt framings of critique when attempting to effect change through or within workplace structures. Instead, it&rsquo;s often a better strategy to work around the middle level or low level of granularity, with the knowledge that there is always more power in numbers than alone, and knowing also that the real system-level critiques can and must guide our thinking about lower-level critiques.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
The best modes of critique weaponize the tech industry&rsquo;s own methods against itself. I mentioned &ldquo;the man in the arena&rdquo; and its correspondence with soft power above, but there are other ways in which companies are often receptive (or vulnerable) to critique of the right kind. Weaponizing a company&rsquo;s mission or values is a classic tactic in grounding critique, and can serve the dual purpose of justifying the critique to management and making visible to other workers the fact that the company is not abiding by its stated values. For companies which are especially &ldquo;mission-driven,&rdquo; this last point can be especially important.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0 c4">
<span class="c1">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c1">
Finally, we discussed during FASPE the place of quitting, which is to say placing a boundary and enforcing it. Quitting with a statement of values can be a powerful tactic at a smaller company, especially while the market is strong. Statements of resignation have often made a big impact in the industry, precisely because they constitute a tear in the fabric of positivity. One strong example that comes to mind is the piece &ldquo;This is Silicon Valley,&rdquo; by Gloria Liou, in 2019. While I&rsquo;m not exactly sure that Gloria left&mdash;a cursory Google search doesn&rsquo;t bring up much&mdash;her writing made waves in the tech industry at the time. Quitting with a statement are last resorts, but it does enable a person to raise critiques that are broader than an individual tech worker might otherwise be able to.</span>
