      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        Poems from a University Quarantine began on March 12, 2020, the day that
        the closing of campus was announced, in The
        Coffee Exchange on Wickenden Street. Since then, the project has
        grown and changed, expanding with the space of the university to encompass
        every place in the world with an Internet connection. We've accomplished
        a lot in the year since that fateful and conspiratorial meeting – from publishing
        over 80 posts over the course of the year to leading tens of workshop sessions
        to hosting a number of speakers. Along the way, we've realized that the core
        of this project revolves around community building through literary practice.
        Here is a taste of all our endeavors, and all the wonderful folks we have met along
        the way!

        <h4>Testimonials</h4>
        <p>
          In all our endeavors, we make sure to ask for feedback from our presenters
          and attendees, to make sure we are constantly improving and responding to
          audience needs and desires! We've been lucky to receive some very kind words in
          the process.

          "I immensely enjoyed leading a translation workshop for Poems from a
          University Quarantine in January 2021. Shira Abramovich and Rachel
          Landau were able to effectively advertise the workshop and
          bring together a large crowd of translators from a range of
          backgrounds and experiences, and fostered an inviting environment
          in which we could experiment with text and learn from each other."

          It really reinspired me to get back into my own work...The exercises...
          pushed me to be more creative. I realized it's worthwhile to just
          let yourself go so to speak....It's all part of the process."

      <h4>The Blog</h4>
      <p>Poems from a University Quarantine began as a humble blog, featuring prompts,
        “letters from quarantine,” and submissions from university affiliates worldwide.
         We've continued to offer prompts and self-care challenges on this blog this past
         fall, and are excited to continue publishing high-quality work.
      </p>
      <p>
        One project which we didn't get to run so far, due to a shortage of funds,
        is a prize. As one of our goals this year is to create a printed anthology,
        <b>funding from this grant will help us offer a prize to the submissions of the highest
        literary or artistic merit</b>, which we hope will increase the overall
        quality and quantity of submissions. <b>We will also be able to hire an external
        contest judge,</b> who will raise the project's profile and further help us attract
        excellent submissions from poets and translators worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, we've been managing all our submissions using email
        and well-organized spreadsheets. While these techniques will continue to serve us
        well, we would like to take our submission management to the next level by
        purchasing a Submittable subscription! Funding for this grant will allow us
        to do exactly that.

      <h4>Workshops</h4>
      <p>
        Workshops are integral to what we do – they are our favorite way to connect
        and share space with others.

        <h5>POETRY is for KITCHENS</h5>
        <img src='./poetry-is-for-kitchens.png' alt-"announcement for poetry is for kitchens, with pink text on a black background"/>
        <p>
          Back in April, the BAI’s curators approached
        us, asking if we would run a <a href"https://quarantine-university.tumblr.com/events">Zoom poetry
        event.</a> We chose to run a two-part lunchtime
        poetry series loosely themed around kitchens and quarantine.
        The workshop was a joy and a success, featuring students, faculty and
        staff from Brown and beyond.

        <p>
          After the success of Poetry is for Kitchens, we embarked on <a href='https://quarantine-university.tumblr.com/summer'>a new
          summer teachng adventure,</a> six weeks long and open to high schoolers
          as well as college students (each in their own cohort and by application).
          At the end, we held an end-of-summer reading for our students.

        <p>
          To kick off the spring semester, we held a
          <a href='https://quarantine-university.tumblr.com/winter'>jam-packed workshop weekend</a> featuring a
          workshop/masterclass with award-winning translator (and co-owner of Riffraff
          Bookstore in Providence) Emma Ramadan. We brought together participants from 11 academic
          institutions and

      <h4>Events</h4>
      <p>
        Over the course of the project, we've held almost 10 non-workshop-based events. These include
        community meet-and-greets, end-of-program readings, and readings from high-profile
        contemporary poets! We've averaged about 15 people per event for community-based events, and 25 for
        readings. We're excited to use funding for this grant to branch out into larger events as well!
      </p>
      <h5>Our attendees!</h5>

      </div>
      <p>
        To get the word out about these events, we use a combination of relentless emails, Mailchimp newsletters,
        Eventbrite, Facebook events, and social media campaigns. All our graphics and assets are
        made in-house using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. <b>Funding from this grant will help us
        advertise our events to a broader audience!</b>

      <h4>What's next?</h4>
      <p>
        The past year has been a wild ride for us as well as for this project. But we're continuing to
        dream bigger and better. With a new website (which I will build – just as I made this HTML project
        history!), more tools, funding to take time off from paid work,
        and continued access to Brown-based resources, we're confident that the project can grow into an
        even stronger community – and carry us beyond the university quarantine whence it originated.
