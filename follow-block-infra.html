            <h2 class="">Introduction</h2>
            <p class="">
              After I wrote up a Trust and Safety plan for Studio, our first
              project was implementing a new social feature and a safety feature
              at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              I was tasked with writing the RFC for the data model for user
              following relationships, as well as user blocking relationships!

            <h2 class="">The spec</h2>
            <p class="">
              Users should be able to follow any other user, as long as these
              requirements are met:
            </p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
              <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                The target (followee) hasn’t blocked the source user;
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
              <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                The source (follower) hasn’t blocked the target user.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="">
              In other words, blocks and follows are relationships that are
              directional, but mutually exclusive. In other words, it’s
              perfectly possible for two users to follow each other, or for two
              users to block each other, but follows and blocks between two
              users cannot coexist. Here’s a demo of the final feature.

            <h2 class="">The tradeoffs</h2>
            <h3 class="">Database technology</h3>
            <p class="">
              We’ve been using both SQL and NoSQL solutions in our code
              recently, with a consensus among engineers to use SQL wherever
              possible.
            </p>
            <p class="">
              I considered storing blocks and follows in each technology. Here’s
              how that could play out, using best practices for each technology:
            </p>
            <ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="1">
              <li>
                NoSQL: store follow/block relationships within the same document
                as other user info, since NoSQL databases are not optimized for
                JOINs.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <ol
              type="1"
              id="d825fee2-0bc2-4537-9f13-886ce67e299e"
              class="numbered-list"
              start="2"
            >
              <li>
                SQL: store follow/block relationships as individual rows within
                a database, then cross-reference that with other tables in order
                to enrich with user information.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p id="57c2831b-4bd6-4856-babe-3c2e14c9636e" class="">
              Given the relational nature of the data, I decided that a
              <strong>SQL-based solution</strong> would be best, since it allows
              us to store the relationships separately, rather than querying a
              larger, potentially unstructured user table (since many noSQL
              technologies don’t provide automatic validation).
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="project-page-two-column">
          <div class="project-page-diagram-section"></div>
          <div class="project-page-body-section">

              How many tables?

            <p id="170b4dfa-c03c-4595-a40e-429c0af98f82" class="">
              Now that I’d decided to store these new relationships in SQL, the
              question came up: should these relationships be stored in one
              database or two?
            </p>
            <p id="2c82c942-5e99-40fa-b50b-b55bc4a51063" class="">
              Here’s the technical dilemma:

            <ul id="1e5ef867-1ee5-4b6d-aea9-814effff8569" class="bulleted-list">
              <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                in
                <strong>one database</strong>
                of user relationships, we can enforce follow/block uniqueness at
                the database level, by implementing a uniqueness constraint on
                source and target users. This is very attractive, since SQL
                promises us uniqueness and is very well-tested on this front,
                and we’d eliminate the need for one-to-one JOINs (which are not
                terribly efficient).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul id="893b5e3c-544b-4f0f-8ff3-ac767badc90b" class="bulleted-list">
              <li style="list-style-type: disc">
                in
                <strong>two databases</strong>, we enforce follow/block
                uniqueness at the data access level, by checking both tables on
                follow and block creation attempts. This includes calls to two
                different databases.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p id="8c86152e-fa35-4b8c-a3e6-1be5ceb92369" class="">
              Framed this way, one database seems quite attractive.
              <strong>However,</strong>
              there’s another, product-based dilemma here: which is more
              futureproof?
            </p>
            <p id="84f84f80-2450-4c3f-88b5-bbe83e60fb29" class="">
              The answer is, most likely,
              <em>two</em>
              databases. We’re not sure this is exactly the structure of user
              relationships that will extend into the future. What if we change
              “follows” to “friends”? Or what if we add another kind of
              relationship? Our one-database solution doesn’t seem as
              futureproof anymore.
            </p>

              As a result, I decided to implement the feature using
              <em>two</em>
              tables,
              <em>two</em>
              direct DAOs, and
              <em>one</em>
              SDK, which in turn is called by the server API. This way, we
              always check both databases before doing any follow or block
              manipulation, but we are free to add or remove user relationships
              in the future.

            <p id="ca213492-15ba-4b3d-b9fb-781a1afeda85" class="">
              Writing up this RFC was a lot of fun, complete with classic
              Alice-and-Bob examples. Now that the feature is complete and has
              its frontend components set up, I’m so excited to see how users
              interact in a more social (following-inclusive)—<em>and</em>
              more protected (blocking-inclusive)—environment.
