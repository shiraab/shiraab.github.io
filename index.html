            is Brown CS's newest introductory computer science course, which
            blends computing foundations and data science. I
            was in charge of creating a coherent curriculum that would teach
            all students, regardless of political leanings or past experience with
            data ethics, to think about the ways in which data and software affect the world,
            and the power that they, as data scientists, would soon have in their grasp.
            In addition to curriculum development and evaluation, I also led grading – which was no small task
            in a class of 300 students.
            We now teach students about data privacy, harmful assumptions in data encoding,
            stakeholders and decision-making, and a little bit about policy. This project was part of Brown CS's
            <a href="http://ethics.cs.brown.edu/">Socially Responsible Computing initiative.</a>
            <br/><br/>
            The following semester, I co-led the responsible computing integration for 
            CS15, Brown CS's oldest running introductory computer science course, taught 
            by Andy van Dam. In a team of two, I was in charge of adding a segment 
            on responsible computing in the news to each lecture – which included 
            everything from the January 6th hearings with Meta to ongoing issues 
            of algorithmic bias to Dr. Timnit Gebru's firing 
            from Google.

            After years of collaborating on experimental poetry projects,
            Rachel Landau and I (aka The Legs of the Corduroy Pants)
            founded and created
            <a href="https://quarantine-university.tumblr.com/">Poems from a
            University Quarantine</a> as a place to stay
            connected and creating during the long months away from school.
            As site manager, I managed its accessibility and organization.
            We ran a two-part workshop series over Zoom with the
            <a href="https://arts.brown.edu/">Brown Arts
            Initiative</a> called POETRY IS FOR KITCHENS. Our summer 2020 programming,
            <a href="https://quarantine-university.tumblr.com/summer">POETRY IS FOR SUMMERS,</a> included a summer workshop
            for high school and college students and a reading series which featured
            poets such as Cassidy McFadzean, Domenica Martinello and Mónica de la Torre.
            This project was supported by a grant from the <a href="https://arts.brown.edu/">Brown Arts Initiative</a> .

          <p id="accessible-tech-hidden" aria-hidden="true">
            Web accessibility is notoriously rare, and many web
            developers say that this is because they were never taught how to
            implement it. As TAs for our department's only Web Development course,
            I was hired to create an all-new accessibility and ethics curriculum.
            The course schedule is extremely tight, since students learn everything
            from HTML basics to frameworks like Vue and React to database management
            to mobile development. The solution? Instead of creating new assignments,
            I took existing assignments and asked what component of
            accessible web development could be taught through it, starting with
            simple principles like alt text and WAI-ARIA landmarks and going up to dynamic text
            resizing and skip links. This project was part of Brown CS's
            <a href="http://ethics.cs.brown.edu/">Socially Responsible Computing initiative.</a>
