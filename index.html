            After years of collaborating on experimental poetry projects,
            Rachel Landau and I (aka The Legs of the Corduroy Pants)
            founded and created
            <a href="https://quarantine-university.tumblr.com/">Poems from a
            University Quarantine</a> as a place to stay
            connected and creating during the long months away from school.
            As site manager, I manage its accessibility and organization.
            We ran a two-part workshop series over Zoom with the
            <a href="https://arts.brown.edu/">Brown Arts
            Initiative</a> called POETRY IS FOR KITCHENS and are
            currently extending the project into
            a summer session curriculum for high school students.

              Place-memory can be loosely described as the set of historical,
              cultural, and social ideas relating to a particular place.
              I planned, led, and conducted a semester-long foray into
              place-memory in literature and history in Paris, culminating
              in a French-language website.

            We worked with an on-campus newspaper to build a map that allows
