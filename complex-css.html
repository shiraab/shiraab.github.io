              Hot take, but I
              <em>love</em>
              CSS. It’s progressed a lot in the past few years, and I think it’s
              really cool that you can do so much with a styling language, which
              is also arguably Turing-complete.

              What I don’t absolutely love are SVGs. They’re a necessary evil on
              the frontend, and they’re extremely powerful—but they are so, so
              finicky, and when developing with them, I often find myself
              resorting to the “change-one-thing-and-see-what-happens” style of
              development until I grok the manipulation patterns of a specific
              shape or stroke. There are SVG manipulation libraries out there
              (for example:
              <a href="https://www.framer.com/">Framer</a>, which is super cool
              but paid), but often if you have a very niche, boutique feature,
              it is worth just biting the bullet and implementing it in straight
              SVG.

              This year, I had the opportunity to lead the charge on a few
              “delight” features at Studio: one was a spinning profile picture
              timer for our new Studio Sessions feature; the other was a
              class-specific feature in Simone Giertz’s Studio class that helped
              students come up with random build ideas. It’s been lovely seeing
              the response to these features, and a nice reminder that going the
              extra mile to create that computed magic can really pay off.

              All of these features were developed using TypeScript React and
              Vanilla Extract, a Tailwind-like CSS framework. Generally, clean
              react patterns are all about state management and storing state in
              variables.

              Developing with SVGs involves a lot of state management, but
              because of the nature of SVGs, it feels a lot more like developing
              with pure HTML and Javascript than developing with React. There’s
              a lot of direct DOM manipulation using <code>ref</code> objects
              (think <code>element.setAttribute</code>), which can feel janky or
              unclean compared to React’s pure-code state management.

              The functions you write to create this complex magic in the
              frontend will be very long; there is no way around that. They’ll
              also have to make some use of lots of number crunching and some
              magic numbers. If you use a lot of SVG manipulation in your app,
              you may want to consider creating helper functions to manage basic
              operations. Each of these features, for example, had a very long
              <code>util</code> file to house all the functions we use and
              separate them out so that they were testable.

              In my experience, there just isn’t a substitute for working with
              SVGs directly if you’re trying to create bespoke elements and
              experiences. And this is the case even if you’re developing
              complex visualizations, say, with D3.js, which relies on
              underlying SVG manipulation as well.

              Conclusion: Long Live the Frontend
            </h3>
            <p id="d9c64ee5-0969-4ab0-8852-83186f723e6c" class="">
              My heart is in the frontend, I can say that. Though I’m a proud
              generalist and therefore a fullstack dev, there is so much joy and
              richness in developing complex features on the frontend.
            </p>
            <p id="b7defedb-407c-44ca-9b50-8a6c48a6d13d" class="">
              I feel that there’s an unfortunate stereotype that frontend devs
              are less rigorous than backend or fullstack devs. Through projects
              like these, my hope is that you understand how much thought,
              iteration, and algorithmic thinking goes into making something
              colorful, delightful, and joyous that users love to use!
