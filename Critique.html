System-level critique is one of the primary ways that &ldquo;tech ethics&rdquo; manifests itself, within and outside of academic spaces. I wanted to dive into a discussion of critique, power, action, and change by naming various levels at which a company and the technology it makes can be critiqued.</span>

Treat this like an opinion piece&mdash;most of it is based on a combination of my personal experience and, shall we say, &ldquo;vibes.&rdquo; I referenced the paper &ldquo;Owning Ethics&rdquo; by Metcalf et al. and the book </span>
<span class="c8">
Work Pray Code</span>
<span class="c6">
&nbsp;by Carolyn Chen in my initial ideation and motivation of this essay. I was trained as a literary scholar, so naturally, I also referenced Foucault&rsquo;s &ldquo;What is Critique?&rdquo; to stabilize my notion of critique and its purpose.</span>

First: critique &amp; distance.</span>
</h2>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span>
Throughout FASPE, I found so many of my peers reluctant to describe themselves as the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; version of their profession. Conversations often started with, &ldquo;Well, I work at X, </span>
<span class="c8">
but</span>
<span>
&hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;m studying Y, </span>
<span class="c8">
but also&hellip;</span>
<span>
&rdquo; This includes me&mdash;I&rsquo;m a software engineer, </span>
<span class="c8">
but</span>
<span class="c6">
&nbsp;I also have a parallel career in translation, which I often felt compelled to emphasize. Why? It&rsquo;s not only because I have a general ambivalence for the tech industry. I realized that I value a level of distance from my work because I value the ability to critique my workplace, my industry, and their relationships to our broader society, even as I attempt to embed myself in all three in order to seize some measure of power and legitimize my critique.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span>
And critique does require some distance&mdash;at least, it requires one not to buy in fully to the promises of an industry like tech that thrives off hype. In his 1978 talk &ldquo;What is Critique?&rdquo;, Michel Foucault describes critique as an &ldquo;instrument&rdquo; or a &ldquo;gaze&rdquo; which is directed towards &ldquo;a domain that it wants very much to police and where it is incapable of laying down the law.&rdquo; In other words, critique is often used in situations where the critiquer has no power of enforcement. This can mean situations where the critiquer does have some measure of power&mdash;Foucault mentions morality in the Church, for instance. It can also mean anywhere the critiquer does not have </span>
<span class="c8">
hard</span>
<span class="c6">
&nbsp;power&mdash;the power to govern, make decisions, or lay down punishment, for example. This means that critique is especially useful in domains where the critiquer cannot claim control. There&rsquo;s no reason to critique when one has power to make change: critique is subordinate to action. This makes it especially unattractive in the cultural norms of the tech industry, which prioritizes action and scale over all else. For startups, there is a very real pressure to move quickly and &ldquo;blitzscale&rdquo; once they have found product-market fit&mdash;otherwise, they will fail to reach the mark of success, which is scaling to tens if not hundreds of times their size. It&rsquo;s impossible to move fast while also moving critically, because such a fast pace requires almost complete immersion.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
Tech&rsquo;s emphasis on action and scale infect everything within the industry&mdash;even and especially working conditions. The technology industry requires almost everything of us tech workers: our time, our creativity, and&mdash;especially recently, especially in startups&mdash;our belief. We are expected to perform high amounts of positivity and &ldquo;buy-in&rdquo;: two antitheses of critique. Across the tech industry, startups have &ldquo;missions&rdquo;; employees are judged during interviews based on whether they believe in it. At face value, that&rsquo;s okay: shouldn&rsquo;t everyone have the opportunity to believe in what they&rsquo;re building? But combined with the US&rsquo;s toxic corporate culture, it can balloon into something cultish and pseudo-spiritual, depriving tech workers of their lives outside of work (through long work hours and expectations of socializing and working in the office).</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span>
Carolyn Chen writes at length about this phenomenon of tech-work-as-spirituality in her recent book </span>
<span class="c8">
Work Pray Code</span>
<span class="c6">
, which I found highly descriptive of the requirement of &ldquo;belief&rdquo; in the tech industry, and the co-optation of religion in service of labor and capitalism. She describes the common phenomenon of workplaces providing all kinds of care work for their (higher-paid) employees&mdash;whether that&rsquo;s a catered lunch, childcare in the workplace, laundry services, or spiritual counseling&mdash;not because of real care (at least not exclusively), but rather in order to further their emotional investment in their workplace and their spiritual identification with work. It&rsquo;s effectively a way to manipulate people into working harder and criticizing less, especially when pressures are high and the workload is overwhelming.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span>
In this effort to make tech work a spiritual endeavor, companies also attempt to make it virtuous. When effective labor in the industry is seen as the highest form of worship at the altar of the workplace, critique becomes difficult or even impossible, both because the distance between workers and their environments has collapsed, and because critique, too, relies on an independent notion of virtue. By critiquing, one says implicitly: I know a better way. When tech workers&mdash;especially software engineers&mdash;express critique, they challenge real power relations in companies and in the industry, but almost more importantly, they puncture the pretty bubble of work as spirituality which companies work so hard to uphold.</span>

Second: &ldquo;Bias for Action,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Man in the Arena,&rdquo; and the critical role of the engineer</span>
</h2>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c9 c8">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
Like much of corporate America, tech tends to be ambivalent or even hostile to critique that comes at the expense of action (i.e., profit). At Amazon, this notion of prioritizing action over all else is called having a &ldquo;Bias for Action,&rdquo; which is one of the company&rsquo;s core leadership values. That is, when in doubt: act. It&rsquo;s not quite as strong as Facebook&rsquo;s old maxim to &ldquo;move fast and break things,&rdquo; but it embodies the same idea: action over thought, always.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
Tech loves what Theodore Roosevelt, in his &ldquo;Citizenship in the Republic&rdquo; speech of 1910, called &ldquo;The Man In the Arena.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is not the critic who counts,&rdquo; Roosevelt said. &ldquo;The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena&hellip;.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
Bias for action, man in the arena, whatever you call it&mdash;the point is, action matters much more than anything else&mdash;and specifically, it matters more than critique.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span>
But the idea of the man in the arena matters also in illuminating the kinds of people who are valued in tech: namely, &ldquo;doers&rdquo; are valued much more than &ldquo;thinkers.&rdquo; This means that software engineers, who often &ldquo;do&rdquo; (read: code) all day, can wield a particularly strong form of soft power, when they play it correctly. Especially at companies with small teams, or at larger companies with an organized workforce, engineers occupy a unique position of clout due to their skilled work, expertise, and cultural attitude of focusing on critical thinking on technical questions, rather than on socio-technical questions. Engineers with a lot of experience, or who are well-regarded within a tech team or company, cannot be accused as readily of being inactive critiquers, out of the supposed arena. As a result, when engineers </span>
<span class="c8">
do</span>
<span class="c6">
&nbsp;choose to make pointed critiques, they have the recourse to their long record of a &ldquo;bias for action,&rdquo; which they can draw on in substantiating the need for critique.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
This approach unfortunately requires us as engineers to pick our battles quite carefully. It's therefore not the best-suited for workplaces where there are multiple egregious problems of the same scale.</span>

Most often, when critiques are raised at this level, they are in response to and in justification of specific company practices. These critiques are always valid, they&rsquo;re just usually not seen as actionable within the scope of the industry.<br>

It&rsquo;s become somewhat more popular, as the tech industry grows less popular, for more companies to see themselves as leading the way for a particular cultural issue, especially if it aligns with their mission, so the response can vary.

A Note on Organizing and High-Level Critique.</span>
</h3>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
Everyone should organize. Organizing means that engineers can more readily and effectively critique at more levels, and that their critiques can more easily be heard and taken into account for the possibility of change.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
Whether this is formal organizing, such as forming or joining a union, or informal organizing, such as discussing workplace issues with fellow employees inside or outside of work, organizing is always a more effective strategy than acting alone.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
The &ldquo;levels of critique&rdquo; above are relevant to organized workplaces too. From discussions with friends working at a variety of companies, it seems that engineers are generally given discretion on code and implementation, and so they may exercise a great deal of power on the level of code. As the levels go up in abstraction and more non-engineers have a stake in decisions, the power of any specific role diminishes, so having more and more people raise their voices is useful.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
I believe that the broadest critiques are the ones that get to the root of the matter, but&mdash;critically&mdash;they are not effective as overt framings of critique when attempting to effect change through or within workplace structures. Instead, it&rsquo;s often a better strategy to work around the middle level or low level of granularity, with the knowledge that there is always more power in numbers than alone, and knowing also that the real system-level critiques can and must guide our thinking about critiques that are more granular.</span>

Critique as Power: Strategies for Being Heard.</span>
</h2>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
The best modes of critique weaponize the tech industry&rsquo;s own methods against itself. I mentioned &ldquo;the man in the arena&rdquo; and its correspondence with soft power above, but there are other ways in which companies are often receptive (or vulnerable) to critique of the right kind. Weaponizing a company&rsquo;s mission or values is a classic tactic in grounding critique, and can serve the dual purpose of justifying the critique to management and making visible to other workers the fact that the company is not abiding by its stated values. For companies which are especially &ldquo;mission-driven,&rdquo; this last point can be especially important.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span>
Ultimately, critique alone will never be an effective strategy for change without actionable steps, and a good critique will provide them. It&rsquo;s important to focus on the question of what to do </span>
<span class="c8">
instead</span>
<span>
, rather than what </span>
<span class="c8">
not</span>
<span class="c6">
&nbsp;to do only. This also makes it easier to justify repeating the critique or modifying it in response to changes, and easier to document discontent.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span class="c6">
Finally, we discussed during FASPE the place of quitting in acting ethically. There are boundaries that we are not willing to cross&mdash;which may have to do with what we are or are not willing to build, or what values we are or are not willing to be associated with.</span>
</p>
<p class="c0">
<span class="c6">
</span>
</p>
<p class="c3">
<span>
If the situation becomes untenable, quitting with a statement of values can be a powerful tactic, especially while the market is strong. Statements of resignation are impactful precisely because they constitute a tear in the fabric of spiritual work, company as family, and general positivity that are all prevalent within the industry. One strong example that comes to mind is the piece &ldquo;This is Silicon Valley,&rdquo; by Gloria Liou, in 2019. Her writing made waves in the tech industry at the time. Quitting with a statement is generally a last resort, but, especially if one&rsquo;s workplace isn&rsquo;t organized, it does often enable a person to raise critiques that are broader than an individual tech worker might otherwise be able to do.</span>
